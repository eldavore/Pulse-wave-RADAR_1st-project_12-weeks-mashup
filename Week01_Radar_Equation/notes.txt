Week 1: Radar Fundamentals & Radar Equation

--------------------------------------------
🎯 Goals:
- Understand different radar types: Pulse, Doppler, FMCW
- Learn and implement the radar range equation
- Visualize how radar parameters affect detection range

--------------------------------------------
🧠 Key Concepts:

1. Radar Types:
   - Pulse Radar: Transmits pulses, measures time delay for range
   - Doppler Radar: Measures velocity via frequency shift
   - FMCW Radar: Continuous frequency-modulated wave for range and velocity

2. Radar Range Equation (simplified form):

   Pr = (Pt * G^2 * λ^2 * σ) / ((4π)^3 * R^4 * L)

   where:
   - Pr: received power
   - Pt: transmitted power
   - G: antenna gain
   - λ: wavelength
   - σ: radar cross section (RCS) of the target
   - R: range to target
   - L: system losses

3. Maximum Detection Range:

   Using minimum detectable power (threshold), solve for R

4. Important Parameters:
   - Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF)
   - Range resolution
   - Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)

--------------------------------------------
🛠 Code / Simulation:

- Created Python/MATLAB script to calculate maximum detection range.
- Plotted detection range vs. transmit power and frequency.
- Visualized effects of varying antenna gain and target RCS.
